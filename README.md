# Customer Churn Prediction API

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end machine learning system that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data.

It goes beyond a typical notebook by integrating:

* data preprocessing
* model training and evaluation
* a production-ready prediction pipeline
* a FastAPI-based REST API

The system allows users to send customer data and receive real-time churn predictions.

## Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical business problem, especially in subscription-based services.

The goal of this project is to:

* identify customers at risk of leaving
* enable proactive retention strategies
* balance predictive performance with business impact

---

## Model Approach

### Data Processing

* Converted `TotalCharges` from string to numeric
* Handled missing values introduced during conversion
* Removed non-informative features (e.g., `customerID`)
* Encoded target variable (`Churn`) as binary

### Feature Engineering

* Numerical features: scaled using `StandardScaler`
* Categorical features: encoded using `OneHotEncoder`
* Combined using `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline`

### Model

* Logistic Regression
* Improved using `class_weight="balanced"` to address class imbalance

---

## Model Performance

| Metric            | Value |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| Accuracy          | ~0.73 |
| Recall (Churn)    | ~0.80 |
| Precision (Churn) | ~0.49 |

### Interpretation

The model was optimized for **recall on churn**, meaning:

* It successfully identifies most customers who will churn
* It may produce more false positives, which is acceptable in many business contexts

In real-world scenarios, missing a churner is typically more costly than incorrectly flagging a non-churner.

## Testing

Run tests using:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

The test suite verifies:

* API availability
* prediction endpoint functionality
* response structure

---

## Key Design Decisions

* **Pipeline-based preprocessing** ensures consistency between training and inference
* **Class imbalance handling** improves detection of churners
* **Full pipeline serialization** simplifies deployment and API integration
* **FastAPI** enables clean, scalable API development

---

## Future Improvements

* Compare models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
* Add model explainability (SHAP / feature importance)
* Containerize with Docker
* Deploy to cloud (Render / AWS)
* Add monitoring and logging

---

## Summary

This project demonstrates the ability to:

* build a complete ML pipeline from raw data to deployment
* make informed modeling decisions based on business context
* expose machine learning models as production-ready APIs
